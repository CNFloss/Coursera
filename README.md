# Coursera Work

## Exercises for [Programming with Google Go](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/google-golang)

### By University of California, Irvine

All of my exercizes for a Coursera course on the basics of the Go programming language.

## Usage

If the Go programming language is not installed follow the official [guide](https://go.dev/doc/install)

Run `go build ./foldername/filename` where foldername is the course and filename is the exercize you want to run and. Then run `./filename` for
Linux/Unix or `.\filename.exe` on Windows.

## Contributing

If you have taken the course and have a more elegant solution for a completed exercize please create
a PR! If you see anything that just needs correction or cleaned up you are also encourged to create a PR!
the latter can be anything like fixing typos or any organization or presentation suggestions.

## A Note for Some

If you are taking this course and are thinking of submitting something you didn't write I would
honestly discourage it. First because that is not the intended purpose of this repository and second
you will only suffer from it.
